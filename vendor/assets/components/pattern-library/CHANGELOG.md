DS Neue Changelog
=================

Breaking changes (anything that would require modifying an application-specific template file) should be listed here for each version.

## 9/05/2013
 - Homepage blocks now need `.row` wrapper around each "row" of content. This allows both the headline text and the CTA to be vertically centered.

## 9/04/2013
 - Search field in utility bar should be wrapped in an `<li>` with class `.search`
 - Homepage boxes now require a `.fixed` class to be of fixed height, as the feature block has been generalized to be flexible height by default.


## 8/15/2013
 - Images inside "three-col" are no longer resized to fit by default. Add a ".block" to the containing div for child element styling.

## 7/23/2013
 - Initial version.
